                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <P>
                    Hello! My name is Kaylin Chin! I was born and raised in Michigan, and developed a passion for indoor-plants at 18! I started with a little golden pothos named Andarna! I've always had a bit of a green thumb, and have kept more than 20 plants in a dorm room!

                <h3>Plant-y Background</h3>
                <P>
                    I've kept a variety of plants, but my main focus areas are pothos and monsteras! I have multiple different varieties of pothos and love leafy foliage on my plants! I've currently got three monstera deliciosa and one of them is a thai constellation! I currently have nearly 30 plants and I've discovered a love for bonsai trees!
                </P>

                <h3>Why Own a Plant Nursery?</h3>
                <p>
                    For me, providing healthy plants to my community is important. Having to pay $20+ for a plant that may come riddled with disease or unwanted pests, rootbound, or half-dead is not what a plant nursery should be about. I believe that when you buy a plant, you should be able to bring it home when it's in peak health!
