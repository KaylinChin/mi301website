                        Hello and welcome to growing season! As many of you known, spring time is the best time to repot any plants you haven't repotted in a while or are in need of a new pot! Some signs your plant may need a new pot is if theres stunted growth, discolored leaves, an increased need for water, or if the roots are coming out of the bottom! Come and join us this friday 4/25 at 4:15 pm for a free event on how to safely repot any of your plants! Bring the plant that needs repotting, and a new pot, or purchase one! We will provide a starter soil mix which has perlite and potting soil and a bit of orchid bark to ensure drainage! If you need the mix to be extra course, please bring your own drainage materials! We can help with any rootbound plants you may have!
